# Codealpha_frontend-
Thrilled to share my project as an frontend development intern at Codealpha. In this 1 month internship I designed a responsive art gallery layout using HTML,CSS and Javascript to make the website interective. I also developed a basic calculator, focusing on clean UI and functional logic handling.
